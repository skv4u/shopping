                <strong>What are the delivery charges?</strong><br>We have streamlined the delivery charges to ensure seamless delivery.<br>Bill value of INR 1000 or above is shipped free of cost pan India.<br>Bill value of lesser than INR 1000 incurs
                a flat shipping charge of INR 60 pan India.<br><br><strong>Why does the delivery date not correspond to the delivery timeline of X-Y business days?</strong><br>It is possible that the Seller or our courier partners have a holiday between
                the day your placed your order and the date of delivery, which is based on the timelines shown on the product page. In this case, we add a day to the estimated date. Some courier partners and Sellers do not work on Sundays and this is
                factored in to the delivery dates.<br><br><strong>What is the estimated delivery time?</strong><br>Sellers generally procure and ship the items within the time specified on the product page. Business days exclude public holidays and Sundays.<br><br>Estimated
                delivery time depends on the following factors:<br><br>1. The Seller offering the product<br>2. Product's availability with the Seller<br>3. The destination to which you want the order shipped to and location of the Seller.<br><br><strong>Are there any hidden costs (sales tax, octroi etc) on items sold by Sellers on SRKK?</strong><br>There
                are NO hidden charges when you make a purchase on SRKK. List prices are final and all-inclusive. The price you see on the product page is exactly what you would pay. Delivery charges are not hidden charges and are charged (if at all) extra

                if any, in shipping particular products to your location<br>3. The availability of reliable courier partners in your location<br>4. At times Sellers prefer not to ship to certain locations. This is entirely at their discretion<br><br><strong>Does SRKK deliver internationally?</strong><br>As
